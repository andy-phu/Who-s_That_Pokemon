6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?

We designed the app with users with physical disabilities in mind, as we made our page entirely usable through hand inputs. Aside from that, we kept everyone in mind as we wanted to create a fun experience for all users.

7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.

The two custom gestures we created are open and closed hand and pointing and closed hand. We chose the specific gestures to ease the learning curve of our application.

8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?

Our app implements the principles of good UI design by keeping the display consistent. Additionally, our UI is user centered as there is no need from navigation from page to page, and the directions on how to use the interface are clearly defined on the page itself.
